## Parameter activity
Parameters of a document are defined in the YAML header, and can pre-populate an Rmarkdown document. To see this in action, download this file for a parameterization activity. As before, move it to an Rstudio project directory. Open the file, and follow these instructions:  
  
1. Click the dropdown menu next to Knit and use Knit with Parameters to render the document  
2. Change the parameter values to match your age and gender, and re-knit.  

This activity doens't have an answer file. Instead, you'll see how changing the parameters can change the output. Try this a few times.  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
make_button(file_name = "6-parameter_activity_file.Rmd", 
            button_style = "danger")
```
