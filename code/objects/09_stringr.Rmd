#Data import
Running this script will import the datasets you need
```{r}
source(here::here("code", "healthcare.R"))
```

#Take a glimpse at the `heart_joined` dataset to look for the variables we'll be searching within
```{r}

```

#How many people having an `"auntie" or "aunt"` in their health history?  
```{r}

```

#How many people have Mother/mother but not grandmothers in their family history?
```{r}

```

#Beginning with `heart_joined`, create a new column called `statin` that detects whether or not a patient is on a statin, "and then" filter the dataset to contain only this subgroup of people. Call this new dataframe `statin_subgroup` 
How many people are in this subgroup?
```{r}
