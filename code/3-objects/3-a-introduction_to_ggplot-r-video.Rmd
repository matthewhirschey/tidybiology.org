### Scratchpad  
Use this console to follow along with the video. For `data`, try `iris` (a built in dataset in R). For x and y variables, try `glimpse`-ing the data to see what options are available. Any of these can then be used.
```{r visualizing_data_scratchpad, exercise = TRUE}
glimpse(iris)
```
