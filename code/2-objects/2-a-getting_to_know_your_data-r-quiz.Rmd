## Double Data Type?

We can see that `happy_full` contains many variables that are of type double. 

```{r quiz-double, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("The `double` data type refers to which of the following?",
    answer("A string"),
    answer("An integer"),
    answer("A number with a decimal point", correct = TRUE),
    answer("A factor"))
)
```
