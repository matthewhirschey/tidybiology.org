# R <br>Packages
Any questions?

## R Packages
The R language contains thousands of functions, data sets, and help pages.  
- but only a few hundred are included when you download R  
  
**This is called 'Base R'**  
  
The other functions, data sets, and help pages are grouped into collections known as packages that you can choose to download or not download.  

## “Verbs” (i.e. functions) act on data

`do_this(to_that)`  
  
`do_this(to_that, using_these)`  
   
*We talked about functions before (e.g. `round(pi, 3)`)*  
  
  
  
  
**Functions are the power of using R**

## Packages contain functions, documentation, data

## CRAN
- Most R packages are stored on CRAN, alongside R.  
- Think of them as optional extensions of the R language.  
  
```{r cran, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.height = '66%', out.width= '66%'}
url <- "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/3cf06d6db4be2bbe3368/raw/b66b0531fb1b86d3e04a003b2e105ad4f147900e/number-of-submitted-packages-to-CRAN.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## Using Packages (Part I)
  
1. `install.packages("tidyverse")`  
  
Do this 1 time per computer.  
  
This command will install the package into your instance of R, whether it is local, on a server, or in the cloud. This is required to use the functions in a package.  
  
## Tidyverse

## Tidyverse Pop Quiz!

The tidyverse contains the following packages (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, hms, stringr, lubridate, forcats, DBI, haven, httr, jsonlite, readxl, rvest, xml2, modelr, tidyverse).   
  
  
  
  
**How would you  install them?**

## Tidyverse Pop Quiz! {.build}
`install.packages("ggplot2")`
`install.packages("dplyr")`
`install.packages("tidyr")`
`install.packages("readr")`
`install.packages("purrr")`
`install.packages("tibble")`
`install.packages("hms")`
`install.packages("stringr")`
`install.packages("lubridate")`
`install.packages("forcats")`
`install.packages("DBI")`
`install.packages("haven")`
`install.packages("httr")`
`install.packages("jsonlite")`
`install.packages("readxl")`
`install.packages("rvest")`
`install.packages("xml2")`
`install.packages("modelr")`
`install.packages("broom")`  
  
  
  
Better:  
`install.packages("tidyverse")`  
An R package that serves as a short cut for installing and loading the components of the tidyverse.

## Using Packages (Part II)
  
1.`install.packages("tidyverse")`  
  
Do this 1 time per *computer*.  
  
  
2.`library(tidyverse)`  
  
Do this 1 time per *session*  
  
## Using Packages (Part II) {.build}
**Downloading a package isn't the same as using it.**  
  
If you'd like to use an R package, you need to tell R.  
You do that by running the command `library`, again followed by parentheses and the package name.  
  
`library(package_name)`  
  
This command loads all of the  functions, data sets, and help pages that come with the package into your R session, where you can use them.  
  
*If you close R, you'll need to reload the package with library() if you want to use it again.*  
  
  
## Using Packages (Part III)
The setup chunk is always run once before anything else  

```{r setup_chunk, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/raw/master/media/setup.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## Set-up Chunk Exercise
Add a setup chunk (as shown below) to the top of `02_rmd_exercise.Rmd`.  
Use it to load the tidyverse package (*remember to run this chunk*)  
Then uncomment and run the final code chunk at the bottom of your file.  
  
```{r setup_chunk2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width='66%'}
url <- "https://github.com/matthewhirschey/tidybiology-plusds/raw/master/media/setup2.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
