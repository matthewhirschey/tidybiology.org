#set-up dataset
```{r}
source(here::here("code", "healthcare.R"))
```

# A note about `here()`
The `here` package is an easy, and reproducible way to set the path of your file.  
For example, your code lives in the /code directory, so to point to it, you simply call the here function, and then put your destination(s) in quotes

`here::here("my", "nested", "file", "lives", "in", "this", "directory", "file.Rmd)`  
  
# Import
Use this code chunk to import the patient history dataset  
* use `read_csv()`
* make sure you point to the right folder
* don't forget to assign it to an object

```{r}

```

# Joins
Remember the code: 
Use `left_join` to combine `heart` with `patient_hx`, calling the new dataframe `heart_join_left`  
*If needed you can `glimpse` each dataframe to find the name of the column in common

```{r}

```
