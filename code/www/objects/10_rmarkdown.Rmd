#What percent of patients in this dataset are male v. female?

#What is the median age of patients

#What is the average cholesterol level of patients at the median age?

#Store a new dataframe object that groups patients by sex and age, and then calculates the average cholesterol levels for patients in this group

#store some of these values, so that you can call them inline below

In the heart study data set, the proportion of females is **%** and males is **%**. The median age of patients in this data set is **median age**, which have an average serum cholesterol level of **chol level num** mg/dl.
