In the heart study data set, the proportion of females is `r freq %>% filter(sex == "female") %>% select(freq) %>% pull()` and males is `r freq %>% filter(sex == "male") %>% select(freq) %>% pull()`. The median age of patients in this data set is `r median`, which have an average serum cholesterol level of `r avg_chol` mg/dl.
