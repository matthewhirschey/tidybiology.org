## Instructions
Watch the video above to see a walk through of installing R and RStudio. Because most data science is carried out on your local machine, you'll want to install:  
- A recent version of R  which is available for free at [cran.r-project.org](cran.r-project.org)  
- A recent version of RStudio Desktop, available for free at [www.rstudio.com/download](www.rstudio.com/download) (use the RStudio Desktop Open Source License version)  
- R packages that you will use. Typically, you will install packages as you need them, but feel free to install a few now that are required for tidybiology. From within your console in Rstudio, type the following commands:  
  
`install.packages("tidyverse")`  
and then type  
`library(tidyverse)`  
  
If this loads the tidyverse suite of packages, then it was a success!  
  
  
Next, install a few more packages. You can either do these one at a time, or you can combine them together using the `c()` function.  
  
`install.package(c("devtools", "rmarkdown"))`
