## Organizing projects in Rstudio

Rstudio uses projects as a top-level organization for code, documentation, and data files related to a data science task.  
  
1. Check out [this page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) from Rstudio about making projects.  
2. Make a new project for tidybiology  
  
Remember, first choose the place where you want your project stored. Then, give the project a name, which will also make a new folder for your project in the place where you are storing the project.
